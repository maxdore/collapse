# Formalization accompanying the paper Elementary simplicial collapses in Cubical Agda

The code in this paper has been checked with Agda version 2.6.3 using the
Cubical library version 0.4.

The folder [literate](https://github.com/maxdore/collapse/tree/main/src)
contains a monolithic literate Agda file which was used to create Agda code in the paper.

The project is better browsable as presented in
[src](https://github.com/maxdore/collapse/tree/main/src). The [examples
folder](https://github.com/maxdore/collapse/tree/main/src/Examples) contains
examples of computations and complexes in our framework. The main result can be
found in [the Collapse
file](https://github.com/maxdore/collapse/tree/main/src/Examples/Collapse.agda).

The [html folder](https://github.com/maxdore/collapse/tree/main/html) contains
an HTML export of the src folder, allowing for easier navigation through the
code.
